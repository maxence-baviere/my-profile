    <p>
      I love IESEG, Github, UX/UI Design, Web-developement and play the piano 🎹. I want to work in the world of marketing to make advertisements that pay tribute to the beauty of all women and restore their confidence in themselves and their bodies ✍️. I want to change the current norms that sexualise women's bodies by imposing a single type of beauty 🙆‍♀️.

    <h2>The Future of Marketing ⏳</h2>
    <p>
      I want to work in marketing so that I can manage teams and change the current advertisements that sexualise women's bodies. My goal is to open the eyes of society to promote all forms of beauty and to give women back their self-confidence 💪.

    <h2>Piano Lover 🎶</h2>
    <p>
      I have been playing the piano since I was 6 years old. It's my passion in life. I find that music is a way to express myself and to find my true identity in order to become completely myself 🚀.
